4. Add the following frameworks:
   - `ScreenCaptureKit.framework`

### 4. Configure Capabilities

1. Select your target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Enable "Hardened Runtime"
4. Under Hardened Runtime, enable:
   - "Disable Library Validation"
   - "Allow DYLD Environment Variables" (for debugging)
5. Ensure the entitlements file is set to `AiShot.entitlements`

## Usage

### Taking a Screenshot

1. Click the camera icon in the menu bar
2. Select "Take Screenshot..."
3. The screen is captured and displayed as a fixed overlay
4. Click and drag to select a region
5. Press ESC to cancel at any time

### Editing the Selection

Once you've selected a region, you can:

1. **Re-select a region**: Click and drag anywhere outside the current selection to create a new selection
2. **Move the region**: Click and drag inside the selected area (when no tool is active)
3. **Resize**: Click and drag the blue corner points
4. **Draw annotations**:
   - Click a tool button (pen, line, arrow, rectangle, circle)
   - Draw on the screenshot
   - Click the same tool again to deselect and return to move/resize mode

### Tools and Controls

The toolbar appears below the selected region with:

**Drawing Tools**:
- Pen - Freehand drawing
- Line - Straight lines
- Arrow - Arrows with arrowheads
- Rectangle - Rectangles
- Circle - Circles/ellipses

**Action Buttons**:

- **Save**: Click "Save" to choose a save location
- **Close**: Click "Close" or press ESC to cancel and close the overlay

## Project Structure

```
AiShot/
├── AiShot.xcodeproj
├── Assets.xcassets
└── Modules/ (app, capture, overlay, settings, AI)
```

### Modules

- App: app entry and menu bar setup
- Capture: screen capture pipeline
- Overlay: selection UI, tools, and AI prompt
- Settings: hotkey and AI preferences
- AI: OpenAI image edit client

## Architecture

1. **AiShot**: Sets up the menu bar icon and handles app lifecycle
2. **ScreenshotManager**: Manages screen capture using ScreenCaptureKit
3. **OverlayWindow**: Displays full-screen overlay with:
   - Fixed background image (captured screen)
   - Region selection (drag to select)
   - Region editing (move, resize, re-select)
   - Drawing tools (pen, line, arrow, rectangle, circle)
   - Toolbar with tools and action buttons
   - AI prompt for editing the selected region
   - All editing happens in overlay mode without switching windows

## Key Technologies

- **ScreenCaptureKit**: macOS framework for screen capture
- **AppKit**: Native macOS UI framework
- **CGContext**: Core Graphics for drawing and image manipulation

## Troubleshooting

### Screen Recording Permission Not Working

1. Quit the app completely
2. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
3. Remove the app from the list if present
4. Run the app again to re-request permission

### App Doesn't Appear in Menu Bar

- Make sure `LSUIElement` is set to `true` in Info.plist
- Check that the app is running (look in Activity Monitor)

### Drawing Tools Not Working

- Make sure you've clicked a tool button first
- Tools only work inside the captured image area
- Click the tool button again to deselect

### Can't Save Images

- Check file system permissions
- Make sure you have write access to the selected directory

## Future Enhancements

- Better AI mask controls to refine edit regions with less manual cleanup.
- More AI models and presets to match different creative styles and use cases.
- Privacy tools (blur/pixelate) to quickly redact sensitive content.
- Manual editing tools to complement AI edits with precise touchups.
- Share to cloud to generate links and sync across devices.
- Capture history to browse, reuse, and manage past screenshots.
- Premium plan with extra AI credits and cloud history for power users.

## License

This is a demonstration project. Feel free to modify and use as needed.

## Notes

- The app uses `UserNotifications` for quick feedback notifications
- Screen capture requires ScreenCaptureKit
- The app sets itself as `.accessory` to hide from the dock
- Window levels are set to `.screenSaver` and `.floating` for proper overlay behavior
